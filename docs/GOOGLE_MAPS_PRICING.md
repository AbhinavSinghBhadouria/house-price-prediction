# 💰 Google Maps API Pricing - Complete Guide

## ✅ Short Answer: **Usually FREE for Small Projects!**

Google gives you **$200 FREE credit every month** which covers most personal/small project usage.

## 🆓 Free Tier Limits (Monthly)

### Maps JavaScript API
- **FREE**: First 28,000 map loads per month
- **After**: $7 per 1,000 additional loads

## 📊 Real-World Usage Examples

### For Your House Price Prediction Project:

**Typical Usage:**
- 100 users per day using the map = 3,000 loads/month
- Each user searches 2 addresses = 200 requests/day = 6,000/month
- Each user gets coordinates = 200 geocoding requests/day = 6,000/month

**Cost Calculation:**
- Maps JavaScript: 3,000 loads = **FREE** ✅ (under 28,000 limit)
- Places API: 6,000 requests = **FREE** ✅ (under daily limit)
- Geocoding: 6,000 requests = **FREE** ✅ (under 40,000 limit)

**Total Cost: $0** 🎉

## 💳 When Do You Pay?

You only pay if you exceed the free limits:

### Example Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Small Project (Your Case)**
- 1,000 map loads/month
- 500 address searches/month
- **Cost: $0** ✅

**Scenario 2: Medium Project**
- 50,000 map loads/month (22,000 over free limit)
- 5,000 address searches/month
- **Cost: ~$154/month** (22 × $7 = $154)

**Scenario 3: Large Project**
- 100,000 map loads/month
- 20,000 address searches/month
- **Cost: ~$504/month**

## 🎯 For Your Project Specifically

**Estimated Monthly Usage:**
- If 10 people use it daily: **$0** ✅
- If 100 people use it daily: **$0** ✅
- If 1,000 people use it daily: **$0** ✅ (still likely free)
- If 10,000+ people use it daily: **Might cost $10-50/month**

## 💡 Cost-Saving Tips

4. **Monitor Usage**: Check your usage dashboard regularly
